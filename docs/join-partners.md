# Join as a community partner

By joining BioImage.IO as a community partner, you will be able to:
 - manage your own model repository
 - show your logo in BioImage.IO
 - associate the logo with predefined tags and content types
 - customize your splash screen with a short description, highlighted features and background image
 - generate url that bring the user directly to the filtered items.

## How to join as a community partner?
It works by placing a manifest file (`manifest.bioimage.io.yaml`) under your project repository, and BioImage.IO will pull the content of your manifest to generate the items in BioImage.IO.

To prepare such a manifest file, follow the example [here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimage-io-models/blob/master/src/manifest.bioimage.io.yaml).

Make a request in the comment box below (if you don't see a comment box in the bottom of this page, click [here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimage-io-models/issues/27)):
1. describe your project
2. include the url to your project repo and the manifest file
3. It is recommended to activate CI tests for your repo, and add one of the BioImage.IO admin team as collabrator to your repo in case we need to make changes to the manifest file.

The admin team will discuss and decide whether we should include your project.
