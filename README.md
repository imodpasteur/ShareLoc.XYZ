# ShareLoc.XYZ
ShareLoc is an open platform for sharing [single-molecule localization microscopy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-021-00038-x) (SMLM) data and tools, as described in
[Ouyang, Bai et al. Nat Meth 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01659-0).

## New to ShareLoc?
Watch this [quick overview tutorial](https://youtu.be/tTOkqzr74wg) to get you started.

Here is a specific tutorial on [how to upload SMLM data](https://youtu.be/tFaEXWmv01g)

## Key features of ShareLoc:
 * Open repository for SMLM data and tools
 * Data are stored on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org), an open repository operated by [CERN](https://home.cern/) 
 * Browser-based SMLM viewer in 2D and 3D, no installation required
 * Flexible ontology-based data annotation using the ontology lookup service [(OLS)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index) run by [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) 
 * Open and extendable via [ImJoy](https://imjoy.io) plugins
 * Easy-to-use upload interface with file preview support
 * Import various file formats

## The SMLM file format

To enable faster preview and portable sharing, we developed a binary and losslessly compressed file format for storing localization tables and image patches.
